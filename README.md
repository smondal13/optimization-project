This repo is about partially following the work of [Waldron et al.(2020), Model-based design of transient flow experiments for the identification of kinetic parameters](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2019/re/c9re00342h) using [`parmest`](https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo/tree/main/pyomo/contrib/parmest) for parameter estimation and [`pyomo.doe`](https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo/tree/main/pyomo/contrib/doe) for optimizing experiments. Although in the original work, the authors solved an ODE instead of solving the PDE directly, in my example, I numerically solved the PDE. 
This work is done as part of trying to implement the above-mentioned DOE tools for some experimental design, and it is not an  exact reproduction of the original work. The model and the data were collected from the paper mentioned above.
